    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <p>I examined the following features: range, mean pitch, most common pitch class, last pitch, and most common rhythmic value.</p>
    <p><a href="data/w4values.xml">These are the values for my piece.</a></p>
    <p><a href="data/w4definitions.xml">These are the definitions for my piece.</a></p>
    <p>I was initially surprised that the most common pitch class was 7, indicating a G, as the G4 note did not appear in my piece at all. However, both G3 and G5 proved frequent in the piece's repetitive chords.</p>
    <h2>Task 2</h2>

    <p>The piano roll was rather unsurprising, as all of the notes in the piece were the same length. The histogram served to better highlight the distribution of G notes which lead to it being the most common pitch class. Interestingly, B4, D4, and F4 contained the same number of instances, which illuminated me to the fact that they never appeared outside of the same chord. The same was also applicable to the chord of G3, C4, and E4.</p>

    <p>This is my piece from week 2.</p>

    <p>This is MuseScore's transcription of the MIDI file.</p>
    <p>The most immediately noticeable difference the change in time signature from 3/4 to 4/4. As the 3/4 time signature is key to the waltz genre, this is a major innacuracy. <br><br>
      Moreover, the generated transcription is in the key of E major, as opposed to the original which was in C major. <br><br>
      The transcription also seems to have misinterpreted the silence at the end of the piece for a continually held B6 and D6. <br><br>
      In general, the transcription features much more complex notation - the original piece features simple chords which repeat for two bars, whereas the transcriptions features chords with additional notes, rests, and held notes. <br><br> 
      The chords also differ from bar to bar where it should be repeated. The rhythm also differs, featuring a variety of note lengths where the original piece only features crotchets. <br><br></p>

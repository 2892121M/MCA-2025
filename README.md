# Waltz dataset
<!-- Version 1.0 -->
**Week 1** - 
The theme of this dataset is piano waltzes. 

A challenge I have experienced in the past when working with music and music curation is assigning metadata to audiofiles for more cohesive display in music players. When downloading mp3s, they often display as basic files with no metadata attached, requiring me to manually enter metadata such as the album art and the titles of the song, artist, and album.
There are both advantages and disadvantages to selecting this genre. Many classical waltz pieces are both widely popular and in the public domain, allowing for easy access to all three types of data. However, some other aspects may pose difficulty - there are various recordings and transcriptions of these works over the years which may pose difficulty in narrowing down my selection for each piece, and there likely won't be a consistent album art for these work due to their age. 

The musical scores of piano waltzes are available through various online curations/datasets. One such curation is the International Music Score Library Project. This website presents its data in a wiki-style fashion, having a dedicated page to waltzes: https://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Waltzes. Within this, clicking on the works will list various music scores and recordings, with some metadata attached; composer editor, engraver, publisher info.

Metadata on the sonatas is offered by the Sheet Music Consortium, but these are specifically in reference to the sheet music renditions of them produced posthumously. As much ofthe website's sheet music is not available online, this lessens its usefulness as a resource.



**Week 2** -
I am manually transcribing Euphemia Allan's 'The Celebrated Chop Waltz', based on the IMSLP's 1940 reprint of the first edition, using Musescore.

The MacOS edition of the app did produce some minor confusion as MuseScore itself had to be installed seperately from a wider launcher titled Muselab, but I managed to quickly figure this out. 

Initially, I experienced some difficulty in trying to untoggle the rest. I soon learned that in order to place notes, I would have to type the corresponding key. This wasn't immediately intuitive to me, although after I figured this out, I found that I was able to manually and intuitively place notes utilising the pen tool as the rests were now toggled off, so this may have been a misunderstanding on my end.

From here, the process became rather straightforward, and I was able to do things such create chords and change the time signature with ease, as well as adding a 'p' symbol to indicate a piano dynamic. I couldn't find 'staccato' text as seen in the original sheet music. The piece is rather repetitive, so I thought I would see if the software allowed for a copy and paste feature. Musescore carried over the intuitive process seen in most other operating systems wherein holding shift allowed for the selection of multiple notes, and this let me copy and paste both individual chords as well as entire bars.

A slight inconvenience was the fact that, when using the keyboard to replace a rest with a note, Musescore would often select the note an octave higher or lower than I wanted, with seemingly little consistency: It selected middle c when I wanted c3 and selected g3 when I wanted g4. This didn't prove too troublesome though, as I was able to drag the note into the correct place afterwards.

Week 4 - 
Of note is that the features 'Last Pitch' and 'Most Common Rhythmic Value' were not present in the latest version of jSymbolic as downloaded from sourceforge [here.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmir/files/jSymbolic/) This may be a parity issue, as I used MacOS for this exercise.

The features I looked at were: Pitch Variety, Range, Mean Pitch, Most Common Pitch, and Repeated Notes.

**[Week 7](https://2892121m.github.io/MCA-2025/metaRAW.html)** -
I added the genre classifications of 'waltz' and 'piano' using the <annot> function. These genres were rather self explanitory - the piece follows the waltz structure in 3/4, and the piece is played using only piano.
I added the specific licensing data of 'CC0 1.0 Universal' using the <accessrestrict> function. I followed the Creative Commons chooser to make this choice - as my piece is a transcription of a pre-existing public domain piece, I wished to give it that same accessibility so that future users can access and transform it easily.

# DeBussy dataset
<!-- Version 1.0 -->
Week 1 - 
The theme of this dataset is DeBussy's piano sonatas. 

A challenge I have experienced in the past when working with music and music curation is assigning metadata to audiofiles for more cohesive display in music players. When downloading mp3s, they often display as basic files with no metadata attached, requiring me to manually enter metadata such as the album art and the titles of the song, artist, and album.
There are both advantages and disadvantages to selecting this artist. Debussy's works are both widely popular and in the public domain, allowing for easy access to all three types of data. However, some other aspects may pose difficulty - there are various recordings and transcriptions of his works over the years which may pose difficulty in narrowing down my selection for each sonata, and there likely won't be a consistent album art for his work due to it's age. 

The musical scores of DeBussy's piano sonatas are available through various online curations/datasets. One such curation is the International Music Score Library Project. This website presents its data in a wiki-style fashion, having a dedicated page to DeBussy which lists his works categorically: https://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Debussy,_Claude. Within this, clicking on the works will list various music scores and recordings, with some metadata attached; editor, engraver, publisher info.

Metadata on the sonatas is offered by the Sheet Music Consortium, but these are specifically in reference to the sheet music renditions of them produced posthumously. As the website's sheet music is not available online, this lessens its usefulness as a resource.

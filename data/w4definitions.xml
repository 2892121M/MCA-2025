      <description>Difference in semitones between the highest and lowest pitches.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Mean Pitch</name>
      <description>Mean MIDI pitch value, averaged across all pitched notes in the piece. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Most Common Pitch Class</name>
      <description>The pitch class that occurs most frequently compared to other pitch classes. A value of 0 corresponds to C, and pitches increase chromatically by semitone in integer untis (e.g. a value of 2 would mean that D is the most common pitch class). Enharmonic equivalents are treated as a single pitch class.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Last Pitch</name>
      <description>The MIDI pitch value of the last note in the piece. If there are multiple notes with simultaneous attacks at the end of the piece, then the one with the lowest pitch is selected. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Most Common Rhythmic Value</name>
      <description>The most common rhythmic value of the music, in quarter note units. So, for example, a Most Common Rhythmic Value of 0.5 would mean that eighth notes occur more frequently than any other rhythmic value. This calculation includes both pitched and unpitched notes, is calculated after rhythmic quantization, is not influenced by tempo, and is calculated without regard to the dynamics, voice or instrument of any given note.</description>

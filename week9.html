    <h1>Week 9</h1>
    <p>The three tracks I looked at were Rachmolchovic's Masquerade Waltz, Tchaiovsky's Swan Lake, and Strauss' Waltz Potpurri. The following data will be in this order.</p>

    <p>Looking at the MFCC analysis, the differences are at their most apparent in feature 0, particularly in the case of Swan Lake. From here, features 1-3 remain distinct between the three pieces, with the peaks of Swan Lake being the shortest, followed by Masquerade Waltz, all the way to Potpurri. However, feature 4 and onward become less distinct between the three pieces, with a few exceptions; the peaks of Potpurri are notably smaller, save for one outlying point. Overall, due to the distinctness of features 0-3, I believe one would be able to tell these pieces apart from the MFCC histograms alone.</p>
